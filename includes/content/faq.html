    <dt>What's a "whois lookup"?</dt>
    <dd><p>It's a database record lookup to see who own a certain domain, when was it registered and so on.</p>

        you can register this domain yourself.</p>
        <p>Wikipedia has a more <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WHOIS">detailed answer</a>.</p>
